**[GiveWP](https://stellarwp.pxf.io/DKXDWq)** is one of the most trusted donation plugins for WordPress — built for nonprofits, charities, churches, and creators to raise funds directly on their sites.

Key features of GiveWP:

- Beautiful donation forms
- One-time or recurring gifts
- Donor tracking
- Integration with Stripe, PayPal, CRMs, and more

But… it’s not cheap:
